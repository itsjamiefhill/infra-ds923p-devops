Yes, after deploying Vault, you'll need to initialize it to set it up for use. The initialization process is critical as it generates the unseal keys and the root token, which are necessary to manage Vault.

I've created a helper script called `vault-init.sh` that will handle the initialization process for you. This script is placed in the `bin` directory during the Vault deployment.

Here's the initialization process:

1. **Deploy Vault** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/05-deploy-vault.sh
   ```

2. **Run the initialization script**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/vault-init.sh
   ```

This script will:
- Check if Vault is running and responding
- Verify if Vault is already initialized (to avoid re-initialization)
- If not initialized, run the `vault operator init` command
- Save the unseal keys and root token to a secure file: `config/vault/vault-init.txt`
- Offer to automatically unseal Vault using the first three unseal keys

The initialization output will contain:
- 5 unseal keys (you need at least 3 to unseal Vault)
- 1 root token (used for initial authentication to Vault)

The script securely stores these in the `config/vault/vault-init.txt` file with restricted permissions (600). It's critically important to secure this file, as anyone with these keys can access your Vault.

After initialization, Vault will be sealed. You'll need to unseal it either:
- During the initialization process (the script asks if you want to unseal it immediately)
- Later using the `./bin/vault-unseal.sh` script

Each time Vault restarts (due to container restart, system reboot, etc.), it will seal itself and you'll need to run the unseal script again.

Important notes:
1. Keep your unseal keys and root token secure
2. In a production environment, you should distribute the unseal keys to different trusted individuals
3. Consider setting up auto-unseal for production use
